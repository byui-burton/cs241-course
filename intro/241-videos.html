        <h1>CS 241 Videos and Demos</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>There are a collection of video links in the text that include demos or extra content for the course. It is highly recommended that you download these to your computer so you can watch them even when you do not have internet connect. These videos are Adobe Flash files (.swf) zipped into a single folder.</p>
        <p>These will correspond the CS 165 elements of our course.</p>
        
        <p>Please note that these videos should not be downloaded to computers in the Linux lab, because they are already available in the lab.</p>
