            <h1>10 Prove : Milestone - Asteroids Part 1</h1>


            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>To help you stay on track to finishing the Asteroids project, you are required to meet certain milestone deliverables. You are encouraged to get further on the project, but this submission is a minimum standard to make sure you are on track.</p>

            <p>Refer to the <a href="241-project-asteroids.html">Asteroids project description</a> for the details of this project.</p>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>For this milestone you need to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>create the classes and stubbed out functions you need</li>
                <li>get large asteroids to display and move</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Thus, at a minimum, you should have the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Classes defined for each of the data types in your program.</li>
                <li>The proper inheritance model among classes.</li>
                <li>All of the necessary functions present to ensure that the program compiles. At this point these will likely be blank stub functions that return hard coded values (e.g., 0, or false) if the function has a non-void return type.</li>
                <li>You should also have stub functions for any methods in your design (even if they are not required to get the Game class to compile).</li>
                <li>It is likely that you will discover other methods that you need while you are programming over the next few weeks, which is just fine. You can add these new methods as the need arises, but you should try to make this as complete as possible at this point.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Then, you should also have:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>5 large asteroids appearing on the screen</li>
                <li>The asteroids moving according to the project specifications</li>
                <li>This requires you to get the game loop working (advance, handleInput, draw).</li>
                <li>You do NOT need to worry about wrapping at this point (i.e., when an object goes of the right side of the screen, you do not need to figure out how to make it appear on the left side of the screen at this point).</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In addition, it would be helpful to have your stub functions call other functions as much as possible, or as much as you can think through at this point. This will help you make progress on your next milestone.</p>

            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>Regardless of the approach you take for your personal development, your program must be able to run in the Linux Lab environment.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>When complete, if necessary, copy your code to the Linux Lab and ensure that it compiles.</li>
                <li>Open the makefile and ensure that it has the proper information in the header (i.e., your name, class, instructor).</li>
                <li>Make sure the name of the assignment is "Milestone 10, Asteroids" (not Assignment 10, or Project 10).</li>
                <li>Create a tar file with all of your files and submit it. For example:</li>
<div class="code">
tar -cf asteroids.tar makefile *.cpp *.h
submit asteroids.tar
</div>
                <li>There is no testBed script for this assignment.</li>
            </ol>
