            <h1>06 Prove : Milestone - Moon Lander</h1>


            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>To help you stay on track to finishing the Moon Lander project, you are required to meet certain milestone deliverables. You are encouraged to get further on the project, but this submission is a minimum standard to make sure you are on track.</p>
            <p>Refer to the <a href="241-project-moon-lander.html">Moon Lander project description</a> for the details of this project.</p>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>For this milestone you need to create a class for your lander and have the lander draw on the screen along with the terrain of the world.</p>
            <p>This means that at a minimum, you need to have:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>A class for the lander.</li>
                    <li>Your lander needs to contain at least a point (it may have other things).</li>
                    <li>Your lander needs to have at least a method to draw (it may have others).</li>
                    <li>Your game class needs to have a lander and call its draw method to render it at its current position.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>The following steps will help you get started:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Refer to the <a href="../intro/241-opengl.html" target="_BLANK">options for working with graphics</a>. Determine which approach you are going to use for working with OpenGL, and get your environment set up.</li>
                <li>Copy the starter files for moon lander to your development environment. These are found at:

<div class="code">
/home/cs241/moonLander/*
</div>
                </li>

                <li>Make sure you can get the terrain of the ground to render.</li>
                <li>Create a class for your lander (including .h and .cpp files), as well as any other classes you want to include for next week.</li>
                <li>Modify the makefile to include any classes you add.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>Regardless of the approach you take for your personal development, your program must be able to run in the Linux Lab environment.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>When complete, if necessary copy your code to the Linux Lab and ensure that it compiles.</li>
                <li>Open the makefile and ensure that it has the proper information in the header (i.e., your name, class, instructor).</li>
                <li>Make sure the name of the assignment is "Milestone 06, Moon Lander" (not Assignment 06, or Project 06).</li>
                <li>Create a tar file with all of your files and submit it. For example:</li>
<div class="code">
tar -cf moonLanderMS.tar makefile *.cpp *.h
submit moonLanderMS.tar
</div>
                <li>There is no testBed script for this assignment.</li>
            </ol>
