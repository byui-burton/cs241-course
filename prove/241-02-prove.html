        <h1>02 Prove : Assignment - Digital Forensics</h1>


        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>ACME Widget Corporation just experienced their first digital security breach. One of their secret widget designs just appeared on the Internet. Now they've hired you as a digital forensics investigator to help determine what additional data might have been involved in the breach.</p>
        <p>One of the first steps in digital forensics is to inspect system logs, particularly file access and user account logs. To assist you in this investigation, you've been given a log from ACME's network server that contains a list of file access times and the users that accessed them.</p>

        <p>Write a program to scan through that log to identify users who accessed files in a particular window of time.</p>


        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                Write a C++ program according to the following:

                <ol>
                    <li>Create a struct for an Access Record that contains a username, a filename, and a long (e.g. very large integer) timestamp.</li>
                    <li>Prompt the user for the name of a file.</li>
                    <li>Read in a list of Access Records from the file and store it in an array of structs.</li>
                    <li>Prompt the user for a start time and an end time for consideration.</li>
                    <li>Display a list of all files that were accessed during that period along with the users that accessed them.</li>
                    <li>For this assignment, you may assume that the information entered is all valid</li>
                    <li>For this assignment, you may assume that there will never be more than 500 lines in a file (so you can declare your array accordingly).</li>
                    <li>Don't forget to break your program into meaningful, cohesive functions!</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>A few hints</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is common to create a function, such as displayRecord, that would take a struct and display it in a proper format.</li>
                <li>Don't forget to use setw() (from the iomanip library) to help with your right alignment.</li>
                <li>Get started early, there are a few tricky aspects to this assignment.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Sample Output</h2>
        <p>
            The following is an example of output for this program:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
Enter the access record file: <span class="user-input">/home/cs241/assign02a.txt</span>

Enter the start time: <span class="user-input">1442000000</span>
Enter the end time: <span class="user-input">1442332025</span>

The following records match your criteria:

      Timestamp                File                User
--------------- ------------------- -------------------
     1442000124           house.pdf             jatkins
     1442001032           users.txt     kevin_tomlinson
     1442210121        accounts.mdb     kevin_tomlinson
     1442300125        vacation.jpg            smitty83
End of records
</div>

The input file could look something like:

<div class="code">
students.txt pricem 1441912123
house.pdf jatkins 1442000124
users.txt kevin_tomlinson 1442001032
accounts.mdb kevin_tomlinson 1442210121
vacation.jpg smitty83 1442300125
calendar.cpp burtons 1442588012
</div>
