            <h1>06 Prepare : Checkpoint B - Moon Lander Design</h1>


            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Your assignment is to design the classes you will need for your moon lander project.</p>
            <p>Refer to the <a href="241-project-moon-lander.html">Moon Lander project description</a> for the details of this project.</p>



            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Prepare UML class diagrams of all the classes that you will have in your program. Make sure to include all of the member variables, constructors, and methods you will need. Please prepare this electronically and print it out.</p>

            <p>The classes will have to exhibit the highest level of encapsulation design. They should be designed for reuse later in the semester.</p>

            <p>For this assignment, you do not need to create a complete design document with all of its sections (but you will do this for future projects). Instead just prepare a class diagram for the classes you will use.</p>

            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>Face to face students should bring a printed copy of their UML diagrams to class. Online students should submit their documents as PDF files in I-Learn.</p>
