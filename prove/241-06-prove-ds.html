        <h1>06 Prove : Data Structures Homework - Stacks</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>This assignment will help you practice using Stacks in C++. It will walk you through a series of steps and then turn you to a quiz in I-Learn to report on your progress.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Write a program that will read in a file containing three kinds of braces: { }, ( ), and [ ]. Your program should display either "Balanced" or "Not balanced". To be balanced, a file must contain the same number of open braces as closed braces, and they must be closed in the reverse order of how they were opened. You should ignore all whitespace.</p>
        <p>The following are examples of balanced braces:</p>
<div class="code">
{ ( [ ] ) }

{ }

[ [ [ ( ) ] ] ]
</div>

        <p>The following are examples of braces that are not balanced:</p>
<div class="code">
{ ( [

{ [ } ]

[ ] ] [
</div>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>We will begin the program together in class. You can start with the file we create by copying it to your current directory: "<code>cp /home/cs241/stacks06/braces.cpp .</code>"

        <h2>TestBed and Submission</h2>
        <p>An automated TestBed script is provided for you. It will test your program on 6 different files.</p>

<div class="code">
testBed cs241/stacks06 braces.cpp
</div>

        <p>These files should have the following results:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>stacks01.txt</code> - Not balanced</li>
            <li><code>stacks02.txt</code> - Balanced</li>
            <li><code>stacks03.txt</code> - Balanced</li>
            <li><code>stacks04.txt</code> - Not balanced</li>
            <li><code>stacks05.txt</code> - Not balanced</li>
            <li><code>stacks06.txt</code> - Balanced</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You will not submit your program for grading, instead take the accompanying I-Learn quiz to report on your progress and your understand of stacks.</p>

        <p>You are encouraged to work with others on the programming and the quiz.</p>
