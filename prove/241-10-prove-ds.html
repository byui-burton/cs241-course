        <h1>10 Prove : Data Structures Homework - Trees, Sets, and Maps</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>This homework has a few quiz questions about the basics of Trees, Sets, and Maps. Then there are two programming exercises to complete. You are encouraged to work together on all parts of this assignment.</p>

        <h2>Programming Exercises</h2>
        <p>Complete the following simple programs before taking the quiz:</p>

        <h3>Part I - Sets</h3>
        <p>Write a program that does the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Declare a <code>set</code> of <code>strings</code>, using the <code>set</code> from the standard template library.</li>
            <li>Prompt the user for a series of words until they type the word, "quit". Insert each of these words into the set.</li>
            <li>Use an iterator to display each word in the set. Note the order.</li>
            <li>Prompt the user for an additional word and display whether or not that word is in the set.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Part II - Maps</h3>
        <p>Write a program that does the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Declare a <code>map</code> that has a <code>string</code> as a key and an <code>int</code> as a value (using the <code>map</code> class from the standard template library).</li>
            <li>Prompt the user for a series of names along with their ages, and store these in your map. Stop when the user users "quit" for the name. (You need not worry about spaces in names.)</li>
            <li>Display all the names stored in your map.</li>
            <li>Prompt the user for a name and if that person is in your map, display their age. If not, display to the user that the person is not in the map.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>There is no testBed for these assignments and they should not be submitted in the Linux lab. Instead, when you are finished, take the accompanying quiz.</p>
