        <h1>05 Prove : Data Structures Homework - Linked Lists</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>This assignment will help you practice using Linked Lists in C++. It will walk you through a series of steps and then turn you to a quiz in I-Learn to report on your progress.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Part I - Basic Use</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Import the "list" library in the standard namespace.</li>
            <li>Create a list to hold integers.</li>
            <li>Prompt the user for how many numbers they would like to enter.</li>
            <li>Using a for loop and push_back() prompt the user for that number of integers and add them to the list.</li>
            <li>Using an iterator loop through and display each number in the list.</li>
            <li>Change the insertion to use push_front() instead of push_back() and repeat the iteration / display.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Part II - Repeat for strings</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Repeat the first part of Part I but instead of having a list of integers, create a list of strings.</li>
            <li>Prompt for the number of strings.</li>
            <li>Loop, prompt, push_back() to put that many strings in the list.</li>
            <li>Use iterators to display each string in the list.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Part III - Removing from a list... (This one is tricky... work together on this if you can!)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start with your code from Part I.</li>
            <li>Prompt the user for a series of numbers and add them to a list of integers.</li>
            <li>Iterate through the list and display them.</li>
            <li>Remove all odd numbers from the list (leaving the evens).</li>
            <li>Iterate through the remaining items and display them.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>After completing these instructions, take the I-Learn quiz. You are encouraged to work with others on the programming and the quiz.</p>
