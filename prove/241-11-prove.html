            <h1>11 Prove : Milestone - Asteroids Part 2</h1>


            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>To help you stay on track to finishing the Asteroids project, you are required to meet certain milestone deliverables. You are encouraged to get further on the project, but this submission is a minimum standard to make sure you are on track.</p>

            <p>Refer to the <a href="241-project-asteroids.html">Asteroids project description</a> for the details of this project.</p>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>For this milestone you should have your ship correctly moving around firing bullets (and the bullets going the correct velocity and dying at the correct time). This means you should also have a completely implemented <code>Velocity</code> class and a <code>FlyingObject</code> class.</p>

            <p>You are not required to have your Rock classes working yet, nor do you need to have wrapping at the screen edges in place. Of course, it is great if you can have them done already!</p>

            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>Regardless of the approach you take for your personal development, your program must be able to run in the Linux Lab environment.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>When complete, if necessary, copy your code to the Linux Lab and ensure that it compiles.</li>
                <li>Open the makefile and ensure that it has the proper information in the header (i.e., your name, class, instructor).</li>
                <li>Make sure the name of the assignment is "Milestone 12, Asteroids" (not Assignment 12, or Project 12). This is a different number than last week.</li>
                <li>Create a tar file with all of your files and submit it. For example:</li>
<div class="code">
tar -cf asteroids.tar makefile *.cpp *.h
submit asteroids.tar
</div>
                <li>There is no testBed script for this assignment.</li>
            </ol>
