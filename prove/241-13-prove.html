        <h1>13 Prove : Assignment - Analyzing a Census</h1>


        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Now that we have discussed several different data structures and algorithms, we can apply those to solve interesting problems.</p>

        <p>This week, your assignment is to write a program to analyze data from a census. This census data is from the 1994 census, and originally comes from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income" target="_BLANK">UCI Machine Learning Data Set Repository</a>. A simplified version is provided in the Linux Lab: <code>/home/cs241/census.txt</code></p>

        <p>The census dataset consists of one record per line. The fields of each record are separated by spaces. For example:</p>

<div class="code">
39 State-gov 77516 Bachelors 13 Never-married Adm-clerical Not-in-family White Male 2174 0 40 United-States &lt;=50K
50 Self-emp-not-inc 83311 Bachelors 13 Married-civ-spouse Exec-managerial Husband White Male 0 0 13 United-States &lt;=50K
38 Private 215646 HS-grad 9 Divorced Handlers-cleaners Not-in-family White Male 0 0 40 United-States &lt;=50K
53 Private 234721 11th 7 Married-civ-spouse Handlers-cleaners Husband Black Male 0 0 40 United-States &lt;=50K
</div>

        <p>According to the dataset description page, the following are the fields of each record along with the possible values:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>age: continuous.</li>
            <li>workclass: Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay, Never-worked.</li>
            <li>fnlwgt: continuous.</li>
            <li>education: Bachelors, Some-college, 11th, HS-grad, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 9th, 7th-8th, 12th, Masters, 1st-4th, 10th, Doctorate, 5th-6th, Preschool.</li>
            <li>education-num: continuous.</li>
            <li>marital-status: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse.</li>
            <li>occupation: Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service, Sales, Exec-managerial, Prof-specialty, Handlers-cleaners, Machine-op-inspct, Adm-clerical, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Priv-house-serv, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces.</li>
            <li>relationship: Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried.</li>
            <li>race: White, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other, Black.</li>
            <li>sex: Female, Male.</li>
            <li>capital-gain: continuous.</li>
            <li>capital-loss: continuous.</li>
            <li>hours-per-week: continuous.</li>
            <li>native-country: United-States, Cambodia, England, Puerto-Rico, Canada, Germany, Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc), India, Japan, Greece, South, China, Cuba, Iran, Honduras, Philippines, Italy, Poland, Jamaica, Vietnam, Mexico, Portugal, Ireland, France, Dominican-Republic, Laos, Ecuador, Taiwan, Haiti, Columbia, Hungary, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Scotland, Thailand, Yugoslavia, El-Salvador, Trinadad&amp;Tobago, Peru, Hong, Holand-Netherlands.</li>
            <li>income: &gt;50K, &lt;=50K.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Write a C++ program that reads in this dataset, parses the fields, and stores them in a data structure(s) for easy lookup later.</p>

            <p>You should only read the file once, and should thoughtfully choose data structures that enable you to store all of the data you need in a way that the desired values can be easily found / computed.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Prompt the user for the location of the census text file.</li>
                <li>Read in the file, close it, and display the text, "Census file loaded."</li>
                <li>List the number of individuals in each occupation.</li>
                <li>Prompt the user for a "native-country", then for that country display the following:</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>The average "education-num" or number of years in school.</li>
                    <li>The number of individuals that have income &gt;50K, and the number &lt;=50K.</li>
                    <li>The number of individuals in each marital category.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Continue prompting the user for a native-country, and repeat the last step, until the user enters: "quit".</li>
            </ol>

            <p>A few other guidelines / hints:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You may create any classes or functions that are helpful.</li>
                <li>You may use any classes or functions from the Standard Template Library (STL) that are helpful. (You might want to consider a data structure that associates keys to values).</li>
                <li>Don't copy the census text file to your home directory, it is large and can fill up your disk quota. If you want a smaller one to work with for testing purposes, you can use: <code>/home/cs241/census_small.txt</code></li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Sample Output</h2>
        <p>
            The following is an example of output for this program:
        </p>

<div class="code">
</div>

        <h2>Testbed and Submission</h2>

        <p>There is no automated testbed script for this assignment.</p>

        <p>When complete, ensure that your program header (either in your makefile or at the top of a single .cpp file) contains the text "Assignment 13, Census".</p>
