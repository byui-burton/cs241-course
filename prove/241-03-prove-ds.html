        <h1>03 Prove : Data Structures Homework - Vector</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>This assignment will help you practice the basics of using Vectors in C++. It will walk you through a series of steps and then turn you to a quiz in I-Learn to report on your findings.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Part I - Basic Vector Operations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a vector to hold strings.</li>
            <li>Using push_back() add 4 strings to the vector: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.</li>
            <li>Use front() and back() to display the first and last strings.</li>
            <li>Use a for loop to iterate through the list, and display each using the square bracket (i.e., v[i]) to access each item. Make sure to use "size()" as the limit for your iterator variable (i.e., i &lt; v.size(). )</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Part II - Observing Vector Growth</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a vector to hold integers.</li>
            <li>Output its size and its capacity, note anything of interest.</li>
            <li>Add 10 numbers.</li>
            <li>Output its size and its capacity, note anything of interest.</li>            
            <li>Change your code to add 100 numbers.</li>
            <li>Output its size and its capacity, note anything of interest.</li>            
            <li>Finally, change your code to insert 1,000 numbers, and also have it output the size and capacity after each number is added.</li>
            <li>Note how often the capacity changes relative to the size.</li>
        </ol>

<!--
        <h3>Part III - Insert and Remove operations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>include the "ctime" library. This will let us output time(0), or the number of seconds since the last "epoch".
            <li>Create a vector to hold integers, with an initial capacity of 500,000,000 (i.e. Vector&lt;int&gt; v(500000000);).</li>
            <li>Output "Started" and the value in <code>time(0)</code>.
            <li>Add 500,000,000 numbers to it, using <code>push_back()</code>.</li>
            <li>Output "Initial list created" and the value in <code>time(0)</code>.</li>
            <li>Add 1 number to the back (using <code>push_back()</code>), and output "Added to back" and the value in <code>time(0)</code>, notice the time taken.</li>
            <li>Add 1 number to the front (using <code>v.insert(v.begin(), num)</code>), and output "Added to front" and the value in <code>time(0)</code>, notice the time taken.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
-->

        <p>After completing these instructions and the preparation reading, take the I-Learn quiz. You are encouraged to work with others on the experimenting and the quiz.</p>
