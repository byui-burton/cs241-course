            <h1>08 Prove : Design - Skeet</h1>


            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Your assignment is to design the classes you will need for your Skeet project and the relationships among them.</p>
            <p>Refer to the <a href="241-project-skeet.html">Skeet project description</a> for the details of this project.</p>



            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Prepare UML class diagrams of all the classes that you will have in your program. Make sure to include all of the member variables, constructors, and methods you will need. Also make sure to indicate any IS-A or HAS-A relationships.</p>

            <p>You do not need to include the Game class, driver, uiInteract, uiDraw in your diagrams.</p>

            <p>Please prepare this electronically.</p>

            <p>The classes will have to exhibit the highest level of encapsulation design. They should be designed for reuse later in the semester.</p>

            <p>For this assignment, you do not need to create a complete design document with all of its sections. Instead just prepare a class diagram for the classes you will use.</p>

            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>Submit this documents as PDF in I-Learn.</p>
