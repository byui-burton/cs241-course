            <h1>09 Prove : Milestone - Skeet</h1>


            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>To help you stay on track to finishing the Skeet project, you are required to meet certain milestone deliverables. You are encouraged to get further on the project, but this submission is a minimum standard to make sure you are on track.</p>

            <p>Refer to the <a href="241-project-skeet.html">Skeet project description</a> for the details of this project.</p>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>For this milestone, you should have all three types of Birds that can be created and fly across the screen. After a Bird leaves the screen, it should be deleted and a new one created at random.</p>

            <p>Thus, at a minimum, you should have the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Classes for each type of Bird (Standard, Strong, and Sacred).</li>
                <li>Correct virtual and pure virtual functions in base classes that are overridden in derived classes.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate that new birds can be created after old ones leave the screen.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate use of polymorphism by having a single <code>Bird*</code> in your game class that can refer to any type of bird. You should NOT have three different Bird objects in your game class.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The following are not specifically required at this point (although having them done already would be a great thing!):</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Collision detection / Bullets hitting Birds</li>
                    <li>Scoring</li>
                    <li>Multiple bullets</li>
                    <li>Features above and beyond the base requirements</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>Regardless of the approach you take for your personal development, your program must be able to run in the Linux Lab environment.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>When complete, if necessary, copy your code to the Linux Lab and ensure that it compiles.</li>
                <li>Open the makefile and ensure that it has the proper information in the header (i.e., your name, class, instructor).</li>
                <li>Make sure the name of the assignment is "Milestone 09, Skeet" (not Assignment 09, or Project 09). This is a different number than last week.</li>
                <li>Create a tar file with all of your files and submit it. For example:</li>
<div class="code">
tar -cf skeet.tar makefile *.cpp *.h
submit skeet.tar
</div>
                <li>There is no testBed script for this assignment.</li>
            </ol>
