            <h1>06 Prove : Milestone - Moon Lander</h1>


            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>To help you stay on track to finishing the Moon Lander project, you are required to meet certain milestone deliverables. You are encouraged to get further on the project, but this submission is a minimum standard to make sure you are on track.</p>
            <p>Refer to the <a href="241-project-moon-lander.html">Moon Lander project description</a> for the details of this project.</p>
            <p>Also, refer to <a href="../intro/241-opengl.html" target="_BLANK">the setup instructions</a> for getting your environment configured.</p>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>For this milestone you need to get the provided code to compile and draw a lander on the screen.</p>
            <p>Notice that the code you are given requires you to put things in place such as a Lander class and many methods of the class. You should create these methods as stub functions at this point (blank functions that don't really do anything but allow it to compile). Then your task for next week is to fill in the body of all of these functions.</p>

            <p>This means that at a minimum, you need to have:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>A class for the lander.</li>
                    <li>Your lander needs to contain at least a <code>Point</code> (it may have other things).</li>
                    <li>You need to fill in the <code>draw</code> method for the <code>Lander</code> class to draw it on the screen (You don't have to draw it at the "correct" location at this point, just somewhere on the screen).</li>
                    <li>You will need to update the makefile to include rules for any files you create (e.g. the Lander class). Don't forget to add a rule to compile it, and also to add them to the rule and dependency list for a.out.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>The following steps will help you get started:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Refer to the <a href="../intro/241-opengl.html" target="_BLANK">options for working with graphics</a>. Determine which approach you are going to use for working with OpenGL, and get your environment set up.</li>
                <li>Copy the starter files for moon lander to your development environment. These are found at:

<div class="code">
/home/cs241/moonLander/*
</div>
                </li>

                <li>Create a class for your lander (including .h and .cpp files) and velocity.</li>
                <li>Modify the makefile to include the classes you add.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>Regardless of the approach you take for your personal development, your program must be able to run in the Linux Lab environment.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>When complete, if necessary copy your code to the Linux Lab and ensure that it compiles.</li>
                <li>Open the makefile and ensure that it has the proper information in the header (i.e., your name, class, instructor).</li>
                <li>Make sure the name of the assignment is "Milestone 06, Moon Lander" (not Assignment 06, or Project 06).</li>
                <li>Create a tar file with all of your files and submit it. For example:</li>
<div class="code">
tar -cf moonLanderMS.tar makefile *.cpp *.h
submit moonLanderMS.tar
</div>
                <li>There is no testBed script for this assignment.</li>
            </ol>
