        <h1>02 Prepare : Checkpoint A - Structs</h1>


        <p>After completing (or <i>while</i> completing) the <a href="241-02-prepare.html">preparation material</a> for this week, complete the following exercise.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This checkpoint is intended to help you practice the mechanics of structs in C++.
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                Write a C++ program according to the following:
            </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Create a struct for a Student, that contains a string for a first name, a string for a last name, and an integer for an id.</li>
                    <li>Create a function called, displayStudent, that accepts a student struct, and displays their information in the following format: "id# - FirstName LastName".</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    The program should do the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Declare a Student struct called "user".</li>
                    <li>Prompt the user for their first name, last name, and id number, and save these values into your "user" struct.</li>
                    <li>Pass the user struct to the display function to be displayed.</li>

                </ol>
            </p>
        <h2>Sample Output</h2>
        <p>
            The following is an example of output for this program:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
Please enter your first name: <span class="user-input">Ashley</span>
Please enter your last name: <span class="user-input">Smith</span>
Please enter your id number: <span class="user-input">12512</span>

Your information:
12512 - Ashley Smith
        </div>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Start your program by copying the template provided at: /home/cs241/checkpoint.cpp . Don't forget to include your name, and then also "Checkpoint 02a, Structs" as the assignment number. To copy the template to your current directory, you could use something like the following:</p>

<div class="code">cp /home/cs241/checkpoint.cpp myCheck02a.cpp</div>

        <h2>Testbed</h2>
        <p>
            A auto-grading testbed script is provided for you to help evaluate your program. This same testbed script will be used to grade your program. It is pass/fail, so your program must pass the testbed completely for you to receive credit for this assignment. You may run the testbed as many times as you like.

        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that it is possible to pass the testbed without using structs, but this would not help you learn, and you will not receive credit if you do not use structs.
        </p>

        <p>For example:</p>
        <div class="code">testBed cs241/check02a myCheck02a.cpp</div>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
            After completing your assignment and ensuring that it conforms to our style guidelines, please submit it via the Linux Lab submit system.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>

        <div class="code">submit myCheck02a.cpp</div>
