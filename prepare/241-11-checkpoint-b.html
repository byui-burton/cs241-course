        <h1>12 Prepare : Checkpoint B - More Sorting</h1>


        <p>After completing (or <i>while</i> completing) the <a href="241-12-prepare.html">preparation material</a> for this week, complete the following exercise.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This checkpoint is intended to help you practice the syntax of a basic sorting algorithm.
        </p>
       
        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <p>For this assignment, you need to implement either a selection sort or an insertion sort, whichever one you did not choose for Checkpoint A.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Copy the template file /home/cs241/check12b.cpp to your working directory.</li>
                <li>Determine which sort you are implementing (either selection or insertion, whichever one you did not do last time).</li>

                <li>Functions are provided for you to prompt the user for a list, pass it to a function to be sorted, and finally display it.</li>

                <li>Your task is to fill in the body of the <code>sort</code> function.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Sample Output</h2>
        <p>
            The following is an example of output for this program:
        </p>
<div class="code">
Enter int: <span class="user-input">3</span>
Enter int: <span class="user-input">12</span>
Enter int: <span class="user-input">4</span>
Enter int: <span class="user-input">0</span>
Your list is:
3
12
4

Enter string: <span class="user-input">The</span>
Enter string: <span class="user-input">quick</span>
Enter string: <span class="user-input">brown</span>
Enter string: <span class="user-input">fox</span>
Enter string: <span class="user-input">jumps</span>
Enter string: <span class="user-input">over</span>
Enter string: <span class="user-input">the</span>
Enter string: <span class="user-input">lazy</span>

        <h2>Testbed</h2>
        <p>
            An auto-grading testbed script is provided for you to help evaluate your program. This same testbed script will be used to grade your program. It is pass/fail, so your program must pass the testbed completely for you to receive credit for this assignment. You may run the testbed as many times as you like.
        </p>
        <p>Please note that it is possible to do this assignment without using one of these sorts, but this will not help you understand the concept, and you will not receive credit if you do not follow the instructions.
        </p>
