        <h1>01 Prepare : Reading - Data Structures : Big-O Notation</h1>


        <p>This semester we will be comparing many different data structures. In so doing, we may want to say "mine is better than yours" in one situation or another, but in order to do that we need to be able to explain or prove that it's true for certain conditions.</p>

        <p>This is where Big-O notation comes into play. It is the language and process we use to be able to rigorous define when something truly is faster or smaller than something else.</p>

        <p>Before coming to class, please read the following:
