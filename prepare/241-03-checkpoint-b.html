        <h1>03 Prepare : Checkpoint B</h1>


        <p>After completing (or <i>while</i> completing) the <a href="241-03-prepare.html">preparation material</a> for this week, complete the following exercise.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This checkpoint is intended to help you practice the syntax of handling errors in streams (e.g., cin.fail()).
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Write a C++ program that prompts the user for a number, but if the user enters a word instead, the program handles it gracefully and re-prompts for a number. In particular:

                <ol>
                    <li>Write a function, <code>prompt</code>, that prompts the user for a number, and returns it.</li>
                    <li>Have <code>main</code> call this function and then display the result.</li>
                    <li>In the <code>prompt</code> function, check for invalid input (i.e., cin.fail()). If a failure condition occurs:</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Clear the fail status.</li>
                            <li>Ignore the rest of the input in the buffer.</li>
                            <li>Display the message: "Invalid input."</li>
                            <li>Then, reprompt for the number.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Continue reprompting as long as the input is invalid.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

        <h2>Sample Output</h2>
        <p>
            The following is an example of output for this program:
        </p>
<div class="code">
Enter a number: <span class="user-input">4</span>
The number is 4.
</div>

<p>Another run may look as follows:</p>
<div class="code">
Enter a number: <span class="user-input">x</span>
Invalid input.
Enter a number: <span class="user-input">6</span>
The number is: 6.
</div>

<p>Another run may look as follows:</p>
<div class="code">
Enter a number: <span class="user-input">Tacos</span>
Invalid input.
Enter a number: <span class="user-input">-32</span>
The number is: -32.
</div>

<p>Another run may look as follows:</p>
<div class="code">
Enter a number: <span class="user-input">And my father dwelt in a tent.</span>
Invalid input.
Enter a number: <span class="user-input">I will go and do...</span>
Invalid input.
Enter a number: <span class="user-input">Press forward with steadfastness...</span>
Invalid input.
Enter a number: <span class="user-input">215</span>
The number is: 215.
</div>


        <h2>Testbed</h2>
        <p>
            A auto-grading testbed script is provided for you to help evaluate your program. This same testbed script will be used to grade your program. It is pass/fail, so your program must pass the testbed completely for you to receive credit for this assignment. You may run the testbed as many times as you like.
        </p>
        <p>Please note that it is possible to do this assignment without checking <code>cin.fail()</code> and subsequently clearing it, but this will not help you understand the concept, and you will not receive credit if you do not.
        </p>

        <p>Run the testbed with something like the following:</p>
        <div class="code">testBed cs241/check03b myCheck03b.cpp</div>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
            After completing your assignment and verifying that it passes the testbed script, please submit it via the Linux Lab submit system. In the header, it should have, "Checkpoint 03b, Errors".
        </p>
        <p>The submit command would be something like:</p>

        <div class="code">submit myCheck03b.cpp</div>
