        <h1>01 Prepare : Checkpoint B</h1>


        <p>After completing (or <i>while</i> completing) the <a href="241-02-prepare.html">preparation material</a> for this week, complete the following exercise.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This checkpoint is intended to help you review the very basics of C++ programming.
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Write a C++ program that takes a list of numbers and displays each one that is divisible by 3. Specifically, you should:

                <ol>
                    <li>Write a function, getSize, that prompts for the size of the list, or the number of integers to be read in.</li>
                    <li>Write a function, getList, that accepts an array of integers and a count. It should prompt the user for the list of numbers and store them in the passed array.</li>
                    <li>Write a function, displayMultiples that accepts the array and its size. It should loop through each element in the array and display it if it is divisible by 3.</li>
                    <li>You may assume that the size of the list will always be less than 20.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        <h2>Sample Output</h2>
        <p>
            The following is an example of output for this program:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
Enter the size of the list: <span class="user-input">5</span>
Enter number for index 0: <span class="user-input">2</span>
Enter number for index 1: <span class="user-input">3</span>
Enter number for index 2: <span class="user-input">4</span>
Enter number for index 3: <span class="user-input">5</span>
Enter number for index 4: <span class="user-input">6</span>

The following are divisible by 3:
3
6
        </div>

        <h2>Testbed</h2>
        <p>
            A auto-grading testbed script is provided for you to help evaluate your program. This same testbed script will be used to grade your program. It is pass/fail, so your program must pass the testbed completely for you to receive credit for this assignment. You may run the testbed as many times as you like.

        </p>

        <p>For example:</p>
        <div class="code">testBed cs241/check01b myCheck01b.cpp</div>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
            After completing your assignment and verifying that it passes the testbed script, please submit it via the Linux Lab submit system. In the header, it should have, "Checkpoint 01b, Arrays".
        </p>
        <p>The submit command would be something like:</p>


        <div class="code">submit myCheck01b.cpp</div>
