        <h1>08 Prepare : Checkpoint A - Inheritance</h1>


        <p>After completing (or <i>while</i> completing) the <a href="241-08-prepare.html">preparation material</a> for this week, complete the following exercise.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This checkpoint is intended to help you practice the syntax of basic inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>In looking at the collection of books next to your bed, you notice that they fall into a few different categories. First, you have your regular books and novels, second, your textbooks, and finally, your collection of picture books :-).</p>

        <p>You quickly recognize that they all have many things in common, but there are some slight differences in the properties of these different kinds of books.</p>

        <p>In particular, all books seem to have the following:
            <ul>
                <li>title : string</li>
                <li>author : string</li>
                <li>publicationYear : int</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>That information captures your regular books and novels fairly well, and yet your textbooks also have a subject they belong to, such as Math, Physics, Computer Science, etc.:
            <ul>
                <li>subject : string</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, your picture books contain all the information of a regular book, but in addition to an author, they also have an illustrator.
            <ul>
                <li>illustrator : string</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>You decide this sounds like a perfect opportunity to practice your new inheritance skills, because you could create a base class for a <code>Book</code>, a derived class <code>TextBook</code> that extends a <code>Book</code>, and another derived class <code>PictureBook</code> that also extends <code>Book</code>.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <p>For this assignment, because the classes we are going to create are so small and simplistic, and to help you focus on just the elements of inheritance, rather than the mechanics of creating lots of files, you will put all of your classes at the top of the main file, rather than creating separate .h and .cpp files like we would for larger, real-world classes.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Copy the template file /home/cs241/check08a.cpp to your working directory.</li>
                <li>Create a class for a <code>Book</code> that has the following member variables:
                    <ul>
                        <li>title : string</li>
                        <li>author : string</li>
                        <li>publicationYear : int</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Next, create a class for a <code>TextBook</code> that extends a <code>Book</code> and adds the following member variable:
                    <ul>
                        <li>subject : string</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Finally, create a class for a <code>PictureBook</code> that that extends a <code>Book</code> and adds the following member variable:
                    <ul>
                        <li>illustrator : string</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>In the base <code>Book</code> class, create a method <code>promptBookInfo</code> that prompts the user for the title, author, and publicationYear, and also a method <code>displayBookInfo</code> that displays the title, author and publication year in the format: "Title (publicationYear) by Author".</li>

                <li>In the <code>TextBook</code> class, create methods <code>promptSubject</code> and <code>displaySubject</code> that prompt and display the subject of the book.</li>

                <li>In the <code>PictureBook</code> class, create methods <code>promptIllustrator</code> and <code>displayIllustrator</code> that prompt and display the Illustrator of the book.</li>

                <li>In <code>main</code>, first create a <code>Book</code> object and call the following methods:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>promptBookInfo</code></li>
                        <li><code>displayBookInfo</code></li>
                    </uL>
                </li>

                <li>Next, create a <code>TextBook</code> object and call the following methods:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>promptBookInfo</code></li>
                        <li><code>promptSubject</code></li>
                        <li><code>displayBookInfo</code></li>
                        <li><code>displaySubject</code></li>
                    </uL>
                </li>

                <li>Finally, create a <code>PictureBook</code> object and call the following methods:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>promptBookInfo</code></li>
                        <li><code>promptIllustrator</code></li>
                        <li><code>displayBookInfo</code></li>
                        <li><code>displayIllustrator</code></li>
                    </uL>
                </li>

            </ol>

        <h2>Testbed</h2>
        <p>
            An auto-grading testbed script is provided for you to help evaluate your program. This same testbed script will be used to grade your program. It is pass/fail, so your program must pass the testbed completely for you to receive credit for this assignment. You may run the testbed as many times as you like.
        </p>
        <p>Please note that it is possible to do this assignment without using inheritance, but this will not help you understand the concept, and you will not receive credit if you do not follow the instructions.
        </p>
