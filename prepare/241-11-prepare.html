        <h1>11 Prepare : Reading</h1>


        <p>This week we will be studying sorting algorithms. There are numerous sites on the Internet that contain good tutorials and examples of these. A few helpful links are provided:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/sorting/" target="_BLANK">topcoder</a> - Has a good explanation of the algorithms and general considerations. The code is in C++, but is sometimes more complicated than it needs to be.</li>
            <li><a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/sorting-algorithms--cms-20670" target="_BLANK">tutsplus</a> - Does a better job of showing the algorithms step by step. The code is in Java and is sometimes more complex than it has to be.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/" target="_BLANK">sorting-algorithms</a> - Great visualizations! The code here is very simple and to the point (albeit in pseudocode). Not much description of the algorithm is provided.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>While there are more to choose from, the following are the algorithms that we will be discussing this semester:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Bubble Sort</li>
            <li>Insertion Sort</li>
            <li>Selection Sort</li>
            <li>Merge Sort</li>
            <li>Quick Sort</li>
        </ul>
