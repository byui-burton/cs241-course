        <h1>01 Prepare : Checkpoint A - C++ Basics</h1>


        <p>After completing (or <em>while</em> completing) the <a href="241-01-prepare.html">preparation material</a> for this week, complete the following checkpoint.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This checkpoint is intended to help you review the very basics of C++ programming and ensure that you can access the Linux Lab and submit homework.
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                Write a C++ program to do the following:

                <ol>
                    <li>Display the text: Hello CS 241 World</li>
                    <li>Prompt the user for their first name</li>
                    <li>Prompt the user for their age</li>
                    <li>Display the user's name and age back to them</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        <h2>Sample Output</h2>
        <p>
            The following is an example of output for this program:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
Hello CS 241 World!
Please enter your first name: <span class="user-input">Emily</span>
Please enter your age: <span class="user-input">25</span>

Hello Emily, you are 25 years old.
        </div>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Start your program by copying the template provided at: /home/cs241/checkpoint.cpp . Don't forget to include your name, and then also "Checkpoint 01a, C++ Basics" as the assignment number. To copy the template to your current directory, you could use something like the following:</p>

<div class="code">cp /home/cs241/checkpoint.cpp myCheck01a.cpp</div>

        <h2>Testbed</h2>
        <p>
            A auto-grading testbed script is provided for you to help evaluate your program. This same testbed script will be used to grade your program. It is pass/fail, so your program must pass the testbed completely for you to receive credit for this assignment. You may run the testbed as many times as you like.

        </p>

        <p>For example:</p>
        <div class="code">testBed cs241/check01a myCheck01a.cpp</div>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
            After completing your assignment and ensuring that it conforms to our style guidelines, please submit it via the Linux Lab submit system.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>

        <div class="code">submit myCheck01a.cpp</div>
