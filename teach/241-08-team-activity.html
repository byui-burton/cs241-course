        <h1>08 Teach : Team Activity - Inheritance</h1>


        <p>This activity is designed to be completed during class.
        </p>

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Create a class to represent a <code>Circle</code>, based on a provided <code>Point</code> class. It has a center (x, y), and a radius. Because a <code>Circle</code> has an x and a y coordinate, and more, one way to view it, would be to consider that a <code>Circle</code> IS-A <code>Point</code>. In this case, the <code>Circle</code> class would inherit from the <code>Point</code> class, and simply add a radius to it.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, another way to view the problem is to consider that a <code>circle</code> HAS-A point as its center, and then also has a radius. With this approach the <code>Circle</code> would not inherit from the <code>Point</code> class, but rather, would have a member variable that is of type <code>Point</code>.</p>

        <p>For this activity, we will explore both options, first focusing on the IS-A relationship, and then the HAS-A approach.</p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>Divide your teams into groups of 2-3. You should all work together on one laptop, then make sure everyone in your team gets a copy of the work that you complete.</p>

        <p>Begin by copying the starting files. These files contain a working point class, skeleton files for your driver and circle class, and a makefile.

<div class="code">
mkdir ta08_isa
cd ta08_isa
cp /home/cs241/ta08/* .
</div>
        </p>

        <p>The provided point class has the following class diagram:</p>

            <div class="class-diagrams">
                <table class="table-class-diagram">
                    <tr><th>Point</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>-x : float</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>-y : float</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr class='class-diagram-spacer'><td></td></tr>
                    <tr><td>+getX() : float</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>+getY() : float</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>+setX(float) : void</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>+setY(float) : void</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>+promptForPoint() : void</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>+display() : void</td></tr>
                </table>
            </div>
        
        <h2>Core Requirements</h2>
        <ol>

            <li><p>Create the basic <code>Circle</code> class as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Create a <code>Circle</code> class that inherits from, or extends, the <code>Point</code> class.</li>
                <li>Create a blank method for promptForCircle and display.</li>
                <li>In main, call these functions and ensure that everything compiles.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li><p>Implement the promptForCircle method. It should ask for a <code>Circle</code> as follows:</p>

<div class="code">
Enter x: <span class="user-input">1</span>
Enter y: <span class="user-input">2</span>
Enter radius: <span class="user-input">3</span>
</div>

            <p>Please note that the <code>Point</code> class has a method called <code>promptForPoint</code>. <strong>Make sure you call this from your method to re-use code!</strong></p>
            </li>

            <li><p>Implement the display method. It should display a <code>Circle</code> as follows:</p>

<div class="code">
(1, 2) - Radius: 3
</div>

            <p>Please not that the <code>Point</code> class has a method called <code>display</code>. <strong>Make sure you call this from your method to re-use code!</strong> (Yes, these methods should both be called "display")</p>
            </li>

        </ol>

        <p>When you complete these requirements, show your code to your instructor to "pass it off"</p>

        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
        <p> After completing the above steps. Make sure that everyone on the entire team is to this point and understands the material. Then, if you have time, move onto the following stretch challenges.</p>

        <p>For the stretch challenge, you will repeat the activity using a HAS-A relationship.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a new directory "ta08-hasa", copy the same starting files to that directory, and create a new <code>Circle</code> class. This time your <code>Circle</code> should NOT inherit from <code>Point</code>, but rather should have a <code>Point</code> as a member variable called center.</p>
                <p>Implement the <code>promptForCircle</code> and <code>display</code> methods for your Circle class as before.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Add getters/setters for <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>radius</code>. This means you need to get/set the values from the inner <code>Point</code>class, by "wrapping" them with new methods.</li>
            <li>Discuss with your team the pros and cons of the IS-A vs HAS-A approach to this problem. Determine which approach you feel is best and why. Then, include your answer and its rationale in your "Lessons Learned" question for the I-Learn assessment.</li>
        </ol>


        <h1>Submission</h1>
        <p>You do not need to submit your program (just make sure that everyone has a copy of it for their reference). Instead, answer the accompanying questions in the I-Learn quiz.</p>
