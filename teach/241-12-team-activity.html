        <h1>12 Teach : Team Activity - Analyzing a Census</h1>


        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Now that we have discussed several different data structures and algorithms, we can apply those to solve interesting problems.</p>

        <p>This week, your assignment is to write a program to analyze data from a census. This census data is from the 1994 census, and originally comes from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income" target="_BLANK">UCI Machine Learning Data Set Repository</a>. A simplified version is provided in the Linux Lab: <code>/home/cs241/census.txt</code></p>

        <p>The census dataset consists of one record per line. The fields of each record are separated by spaces. For example:</p>

<div class="code">
39 State-gov 77516 Bachelors 13 Never-married Adm-clerical Not-in-family White Male 2174 0 40 United-States &lt;=50K
50 Self-emp-not-inc 83311 Bachelors 13 Married-civ-spouse Exec-managerial Husband White Male 0 0 13 United-States &lt;=50K
38 Private 215646 HS-grad 9 Divorced Handlers-cleaners Not-in-family White Male 0 0 40 United-States &lt;=50K
53 Private 234721 11th 7 Married-civ-spouse Handlers-cleaners Husband Black Male 0 0 40 United-States &lt;=50K
</div>

        <p>According to the dataset description page, the following are the fields of each record along with the possible values:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>age: continuous.</li>
            <li>workclass: Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay, Never-worked.</li>
            <li>fnlwgt: continuous.</li>
            <li>education: Bachelors, Some-college, 11th, HS-grad, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 9th, 7th-8th, 12th, Masters, 1st-4th, 10th, Doctorate, 5th-6th, Preschool.</li>
            <li>education-num: continuous.</li>
            <li>marital-status: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse.</li>
            <li>occupation: Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service, Sales, Exec-managerial, Prof-specialty, Handlers-cleaners, Machine-op-inspct, Adm-clerical, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Priv-house-serv, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces.</li>
            <li>relationship: Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried.</li>
            <li>race: White, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other, Black.</li>
            <li>sex: Female, Male.</li>
            <li>capital-gain: continuous.</li>
            <li>capital-loss: continuous.</li>
            <li>hours-per-week: continuous.</li>
            <li>native-country: United-States, Cambodia, England, Puerto-Rico, Canada, Germany, Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc), India, Japan, Greece, South, China, Cuba, Iran, Honduras, Philippines, Italy, Poland, Jamaica, Vietnam, Mexico, Portugal, Ireland, France, Dominican-Republic, Laos, Ecuador, Taiwan, Haiti, Columbia, Hungary, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Scotland, Thailand, Yugoslavia, El-Salvador, Trinadad&amp;Tobago, Peru, Hong, Holand-Netherlands.</li>
            <li>income: &gt;50K, &lt;=50K.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Write a C++ program that reads in this dataset, parses the fields, and stores them in a data structure(s) for easy lookup later.</p>

            <p>You should only read the file once, and should thoughtfully choose data structures that enable you to store all of the data you need in a way that the desired values can be easily found / computed.</p>

            <p>Some sample code to simplify reading the files is provided at: <code>/home/cs241/ta12.cpp</code></p>

        <h3>Core Requirements</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Prompt the user for the location of the census text file. Read in the file, close it, and display the text, "Census file loaded."</li>
                <li>In some data structure, store the number of individuals in each occupation. This should be flexible enough that you do not need to create a named variabled for each one (e.g., salesCount, farmingCount), in case there are other occupations in future files.</li>
                <li>Display each occupation along with the number of individuals in each.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
            <p>Prompt the user for a "native-country", then for that country display the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>The average "education-num" or number of years in school.</li>
                <li>The number of individuals that have income &gt;50K, and the number &lt;=50K.</li>
                <li>The number of individuals in each marital category.</li>
            </ol>
                <p>Continue prompting the user for a native-country, and repeat the last step, until the user enters: "quit".</p>

            <h2>A few other guidelines / hints:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You may create any classes or functions that are helpful.</li>
                <li>You may use any classes or functions from the Standard Template Library (STL) that are helpful. (You might want to consider a data structure that associates keys to values).</li>
                <li>Don't copy the census text file to your home directory, it is large and can fill up your disk quota. If you want a smaller one to work with for testing purposes, you can use: <code>/home/cs241/census_small.txt</code></li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Instructor's Solution</h1>
        <p>As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.</p>

        <p>Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.</p>

        <p>After working with your team for the one hour activity, <a href="https://github.com/byui-burton/cs241-course/tree/master/teach/241-12-ta-solution.cpp" target="_BLANK">click here for the instructor's solution</a>.</p>
        <h1>Submission</h1>
        <p>You do not need to submit your program (just make sure that everyone has a copy of it for their reference). Instead, answer the accompanying questions in the I-Learn quiz.</p>
