        <h1>06 Teach : Team Activity - OpenGL Environments</h1>

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>For the team activity today, your goal is to help your classmates (and yourself) get an environment up and running for OpenGL development.</p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>Today, rather than work with your traditional teams, you should find other students who are looking at the same OpenGL option that you are. Then, help each other get it working.</p>

        <p>This activity is designed to be completed in class. Before coming, you should identify what OpenGL option you are going to choose and get the necessary files downloaded.</p>

        <p><a href="../intro/241-opengl.html" target="_BLANK">See here</a> for instructions of setting up and OpenGL environment.</p>
        
        <h1>Completion</h1>
        <p>You should be able to run the "uiTest" program on your computer and move around the shape on the screen.</p>

        <p>For the submission the following are the core and stretch requirements for this activity:</p>

        <p>Core Requirements</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Environment of your choice is downloaded / installed.</li>
            <li><code>uiTest</code> program is copied to your system.</li>
            <li><code>uiTest</code> program runs on your system.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Stretch Challenges</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Moon lander starting code is copied over to your environment.</li>
            <li>A class is at least created for your lander class.</li>
            <li>Moon lander program starting code compiles and runs on your system.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Submission</h1>
        <p>When you have your environment up and running, answer the accompanying questions in the I-Learn quiz.</p>

        <p>There is no instructor solution for this assignment. You may simply put "N/A" in that question box.</p>
