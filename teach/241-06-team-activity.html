        <h1>06 Teach : Team Activity - OpenGL Environments</h1>


        <p>This activity is designed to be completed during class.
        </p>

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>For the team activity today, your goal is to help your classmates (and yourself) get an environment up and running for OpenGL development.</p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>Today, rather than work with your traditional teams, you should find other students who are looking at the same OpenGL option that you are. Then, help each other get it working.</p>

        <p><a href="../intro/241-opengl.html" target="_BLANK">See here</a> for instructions of setting up and OpenGL environment.</p>
        
        <h1>Completion</h1>
        <p>You should be able to run the "uiTest" program on your computer and move around the shape on the screen.</p>

        <h1>Submission</h1>
        <p>When you have your environment up and running, answer the accompanying questions in the I-Learn quiz.</p>
