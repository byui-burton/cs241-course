        <h1>11 Teach : Team Activity - Sorting</h1>


        <p>This activity is designed to be completed during class.
        </p>

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>This activity will help you practice the merge sort algorithm.</p>

        <p>Your assignment is to read in a list of integers from a file, sort them via a merge sort and display them.</p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>Divide your teams into groups of 2-3. You should all work together on one laptop, then make sure everyone in your team gets a copy of the work that you complete.</p>

        <p>Begin with the starting file: <code>/home/cs241/ta11.cpp</code></p>

        <p>This file provides methods to read words from a file and display them. Your task is to write the merge sort.</p>
        
        <h2>Core Requirements</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a sort function that calls itelf. Add the base case to return if the list is small enough.</li>
            <li>Add the logic to divide the array in half and to call the sort on each half.</li>
            <li>Add logic to merge the two pieces back together.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Test your code on the following files:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><code>/home/cs241/ta11/nums1.txt</code></li>
            <li><code>/home/cs241/ta11/nums2.txt</code></li>
            <li><code>/home/cs241/ta11/nums3.txt</code></li>
            <li><code>/home/cs241/ta11/nums4.txt</code></li>
        </ol>

        <p>When you complete these requirements, show your code to your instructor to "pass it off."</p>

        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
        <p> After completing the above steps. Make sure that everyone on the entire team is to this point and understands the material. Then, if you have time, move onto the following stretch challenges.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Change your code to use vectors rather than arrays.</li>
            <li>Change your code to put the numbers into a built in data structure that maintains sorted order, then iterate through it to display the sorted list.</li>
            <li>Create another function that can sort lists of strings.</li>
        </ol>


        <h1>Submission</h1>
        <p>You do not need to submit your program (just make sure that everyone has a copy of it for their reference). Instead, answer the accompanying questions in the I-Learn quiz.</p>
