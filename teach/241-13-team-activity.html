        <h1>13 Teach : Team Activity - Linux Shell Scripts</h1>


        <p>This activity is designed to be completed during class.
        </p>

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>This activity will help you practice writing shell scripts in Linux.</p>

        <p>Your assignment is to write a shell script that accepts a directory as a command line parameter, and then iterates through the .cpp files in that directory.</p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>Divide your teams into groups of 2-3. You should all work together on one laptop, then make sure everyone in your team gets a copy of the work that you complete.</p>

        <h2>Core Requirements</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Create a shell script that accepts a file as a command line parameter and then displays it to the screen as follows: (The dollar sign below just means you are typing it at the command line)</p>

<div class="code">
$ ./lineCounter.sh myFile.cpp
Running on file: myFile.cpp

</div>
                <p>Make your script executable and ensure that it runs.</li>

            <li>Have your script count the number of lines in that file and display it to the screen. For example:</li>

<div class="code">
$ ./lineCounter.sh myFile.cpp 
Running on file: myFile.cpp
127 myFile.cpp
</div>

           <li>Change your script to accept a directory (rather than a file) as the command line parameter. Then have it iterate through all <code>.cpp</code> files in that directory and for each one, display the name of the file and the number of lines in that file.</li>     

<div class="code">
$ ./lineCounter.sh /home/cs241
Running on directory: /home/cs241
Files in the directory:
60 /home/cs241/check02b.cpp
47 /home/cs241/check08a.cpp
49 /home/cs241/check09a.cpp
151 /home/cs241/check09b.cpp
26 /home/cs241/check10a.cpp
212 /home/cs241/check10b.cpp
84 /home/cs241/check11a.cpp
84 /home/cs241/check11b.cpp
47 /home/cs241/check12a.cpp
21 /home/cs241/checkpoint.cpp
47 /home/cs241/ta03.cpp
47 /home/cs241/ta07.cpp
59 /home/cs241/ta09.cpp
75 /home/cs241/ta11.cpp
103 /home/cs241/ta12.cpp
29 /home/cs241/template.cpp
</div>

<!--            <li>Have your script compile this file to create an executable named <em>source-file</em>.out . So for example, if the input file was <code>/home/cs241/inClass/fileReview.cpp</code> the executable would be named, <code>fileReview.out</code> .</li>
            
            <li>Change your script to accept a directory (rather than a file) as the command line parameter. Then have it iterate through all <code>.cpp</code> files in that directory. For each one, do the following:</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Display a message of what file your program is looking at.</li>
                <li>Try to compile it using the naming approach from above.</li>
                <li>If it does not compile, display a message and move on to the next one.</li>
            </ol>
 -->       
        </ol>

        <p>When you complete these requirements, show your code to your instructor to "pass it off."</p>

        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
        <p> After completing the above steps. Make sure that everyone on the entire team is to this point and understands the material. Then, if you have time, move onto the following stretch challenges.</p>

        <ol>
<!--             <li>Change the above script to look in the file for a "cin" statement. If the file has a "cin" statement, skip it and move on to the next one. If it does not, have your program compile it, run the executable, and save the results to a file named <em>source-file</em>-out.txt, (e.g., <code>fileReview-out.txt</code>).</li> -->
 
<!--             <li>Have your script sum up all the lines of all the <code>.cpp</code> files in the given directory, and display the total number of lines at the very end.</li>
 -->
            <li>Change your script so that the number of lines per file is saved to an output file, rather than to the screen. Specify the output file with another parameter (e.g., <code>./lineCounter.sh /home/cs241 cppLines.txt</code>)

            <li>Change your script so that it looks through sub-directories (just one level deep) for <code>.cpp</code> files as well.</li>

            <li>Change your script so that in additional to accepting a directory name, it also accepts a list of potential extensions (e.g., <code>./lineCounter.sh /home/cs241 cppLines.txt cpp h txt</code>). Then, have it count the lines in all of those types of files.</li>
        </ol>


        <h1>Submission</h1>
        <p>You do not need to submit your program (just make sure that everyone has a copy of it for their reference). Instead, answer the accompanying questions in the I-Learn quiz.</p>
